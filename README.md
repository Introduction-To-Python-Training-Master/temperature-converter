	Boilerplate code for the Temperature Converter

## Purpose 

The purpose of the code repo is to serve as the boilerplate code for the temperature converter assignment. This is part of the python training online course.

It shall form the basic code for all the assignments that shall be used in the class.

## Content

The file contains 

1. a README

	As the name implies, the `README.md` file is a documentation file. It explains what the python project is all about and how to begin writing code for the assignments.

1. main.py

	The `main.py` file is the entry point to the project. This is where all your code implementation should take place.

1. requirements.txt

	The `requirements.txt` file allows users to know the required packages/libraries that needs to be installed.

	&nbsp;

	The requirements.txt file contains one line per package. Each line contains the package name, and optionally, the requested version. 

	For more info, see [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files)

> Enter the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit: 50
> The temperature in degrees Celsius is 10.0

&nbsp;

> Note:
> make sure your answer is rounded to one decimal place to pass all the tests.
 


## Todo

You are requided to do the following
1. In `main.py`, write your code in bewteen the lines `19` and `22`.
1. When you are done, you can submit your code for automatic grading. For help click [here](#Help)

## Help 
	Helper commands used in git in the command line

When you are ready to push your code to the remote repository, commit the changes to your code following this guide:

&nbsp;

* check the status of your local branch with remote
in your command promp, run `git status`

* add the files, run `git add .`
* commit your changes using `git commit -m "your commit message"`
